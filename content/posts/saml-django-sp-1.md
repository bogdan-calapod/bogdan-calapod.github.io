Recently I've had to implement the SAML Service Provider logic in Django.
Since it's been a bit woozy, I thought of writing down the gotchas I've been
through here for both future reference but also for anyone else who may be
interested.

This is gonna be a multi-parter, with this one covering the theory of it.

{{< notice info >}}
Note: This blog post describes my understanding of how SAML works, and the
process in which I implemented it in a Django + React app.

I might be wrong on some things, as SAML is a complicated topic and I may have
gotten some things wonky or misunderstood. ðŸ¤“ I'll update this post as soon as
I find out that something's wrong or incorrect.

## ðŸ¤” What is SAML ?

```goat
 .------------------.         .-------------------.
|  Service Provider  | <---> |  Identity Provider  |
 '------------------'         '-------------------'
```

If you ever used one of those fancy `Log in with Google` buttons on a website,
you either used OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML. What both of these protocols do
is basically allow you to log in to a website with an account created on another
website. Magic, right ?
{{< notice note >}}
You'll also see this mentioned as `SSO`, or `Single Sign-On`. Both SAML and OIDC
are SSO Protocols.
{{< /notice >}}
SSO is a great thing to have in any app, simplifying the user experience (and
avoiding the need for users to have _yet another password_ they can forget).

Some terms you'll see _very_ often when looking into SAML specifically, but
also SSO generally, are _Service Provider_ and _Identity Provider_:

- ðŸ›’ **Service Provider (SP)**: Is the application that, well, provides a service.
  If you are developing your own app, this is usually you!
- ðŸ’³ **Identity Provider (IdP)**: This is the service which tells you who's
  interacting with your service. This is usually some big service like Google
  or Microsoft, but you can also implement _your own IdP_ pretty easily-ish
  (expect an article on that soon).

There are also some peculiarities on SAML that you ain't gonna see in usual
modern web protocols:

- ðŸ“„ **XML Everywhere**: Yeah, no JSON here ðŸ¤ª SAML is pretty old, dating back
  to the [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol era.
- ðŸ”„ **Re-implementing some concepts**: You'd think that with SAML being used
  via HTTP, you'd make use of stuff like HTTP methods and encryption. SAML does
  not really enforce anything here, and even has a way to provide a certificate
  in the messages itself, as an extra encryption method.
- ðŸ’¬ **Very verbose**: As all XML protocols tend to be, SAML is _very chatty_.
  A simple SAML message (usually called `assertion`) is pretty big compared to,
  for example, a simple JWT token.
- ðŸ”§ **Very configurable**: SAML can do more than just authentication (but
  we'll only talk about that here) - it can also provide role information,
  user groups or even preferences on login - as long as your application
  implements them and your IdP provides them.

The SP and IdP are the main players here. Let's see how they work together,
shall we ?

## ðŸ”€ The flow

SAML has two ways of working, depending on there the user ends up first:

- ðŸ’³ **IdP-initiated flow** - this is where the user goes on a main page, for
  example a "portal" type app, and then can select any number of apps to use.
  All those various apps are gonna automatically know who logs in, so no extra
  credentials are needed.
- ðŸ›’ **SP-initiated flow** - this is the more typical `Login with XYZ` buttons
  you see in various applications on the internet.

{{< notice tip >}}
The SP-initiated flow has some extra steps, but afterwards they are basically
identical.
{{< /notice >}}

This flowchart shows the main steps in a SP-initiated flow. For the user,
this is mostly seamless:

- Click on the `ðŸ”‘ Login with XYZ` button
  - If the user isn't logged into XYZ, then log in
- ðŸ•’ Wait a bit while there are some page changes
- âœ¨ User is logged in

What happens in the background isn't that much complicated, it's just some
messages being passed around via URL redirects:

```goat
 .------.                   .-------------------.
|  User  | - Clicks on --> |  ðŸ”‘ Login with XYZ   | -------------+
 '------'                   '-------------------'                |
                                                                 |
                                                       SP generates assertion
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                    Redirects to IdP + assertion
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                                 v
                                                        .--------------------.
Redirects to SP + assertion ------ User logs in -----  | IdP shows login page |
             |                                          '--------------------'
             |                                                   ^
             |                                                   |
             |                                                   |
             |                                          IdP flow starts here
             |
             |
             |        .------------------------------------------------.
             +-----> |  âœ… SP checks the assertion and logs in the user  |
                      '------------------------------------------------'
```

{{< notice note >}}
Of course, this is just the happy path. Errors and extra checks can happen,
but we're keeping this as simple as we can.
{{< /notice >}}

If the user were to go to the **IdP-initiated flow**, then the flow would start
at the `IdP shows login page` step, and instead of the IdP automatically
redirecting to the service provider (the app), the user has to select which
app to use from, for example, a list of icons. Think Google's Apps menu where
you can go to Drive, Docs, YouTube, etc. for example.

## ðŸ“œ What's an assertion ?

An assertion is basically a message containing some SAML data. For example:

- The SP info
  - Usually this includes the URL of the app the user wants to log into
  - This is mandatory, as the IdP has a _whitelist_ of allowed SPs
  - It can also include other info, such as an access key or requested permissions
- The login response from the IdP
  - This is sent back to the SP after the IdP logged in successfully
  - It includes user info, at a minimum a name or field on which the SP can
    match the user with its database
  - This is very flexible, so exact fields may vary from app to app

## âœ¨ Conclusion

SAML is a very useful protocol to know and to implement. You'll find that, for
example, most corporate apps (Java ðŸ’ª) have support for SAML already implemented,
and most other enterprise services can act as a SAML IdP for authentication.

SAML also helps if you are planning to deliver apps to any large client, as
they can centralize access for all their users in one place - adding, removing
or editing apps is done in the IdP, and all their apps know who is who.

Next up, we'll see how to implement this flow in a Django app acting as an API
for a React SPA. Let's see how it goes ðŸ¤ž
