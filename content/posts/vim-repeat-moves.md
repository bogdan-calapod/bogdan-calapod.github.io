I have started using [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for the past few months and I am loving it - I won't go here over the details, but suffice to say it's a great editor.
My Vim-fu though isn't that great yet, and while I'm still learning, I'll post `#quickbits` with useful stuff that I want to remember for later.

The first one that I have found which I find it helps a lot is the `f` and `t` repeat shortcut: pressing `;` will repeat the last `f` or `t` motion.

When first getting started with Vim, a lot of articles talk about the `f` (go to character) and the `t` (go up to character) motions, as well as the `.` (repeat edit). I've somehow missed the `;` motion, and want to make sure I keep it in mind in the future. ðŸ˜€
