If you are a Microsoft 365 subscriber, you most certainly have received an
e-mail looking like this:

I get that price increases happen, especially after the rampant inflation these
past few years, but [this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYVPThx7yss)
by Atomic Shrimp pointed out that this price increase isn't really a price
increase, nor an upgrade.

No matter how you feel about AI and Copilot, I think you should be given a
choice on whether you want to use it or not.

In the video above, Atomic Shrimp points out that this is basically just a
naming shenanigan:

- Your current subscription still exists as M365 Family Classic (the one
  without Copilot)
- Your non-Copilot subscription has been basically "upgraded" to M365 Family,
  which includes 60 "free" Copilot credits (but not actually free because
  there's a price bump.)

So Microsoft is basically tying to pull a fast one in order to increase usage
of Copilot across their user base. And I don't have a problem with that,
**_as long as you're open about it_**.

## ðŸ¤” How to revert the price change of M365 (and also disable Copilot)

In the video above, Atomic Shrimp mentions that they contacted Microsoft Sales
to be able to downgrade. In my case, this was not necessary:

- Go to [the Microsoft 365 Billing page](https://account.microsoft.com/services/microsoft365/details#billing)
- Hit `Cancel Subscription` (no worries, it won't cancel anything right now)
- On the new page that loads, on the lower part you will be presented with
  multiple subscription options:

- Click on `Switch Plan` under `M365 Family Classic` (note that it also has a
  yellow border saying `Lower price without AI`)
- Confirm your payment method (note: no payment will actually be done)
- ðŸŽ‰ Enjoy your classic subscription with a lower price!

I hate that companies feel the need to do shady stuff like this. It breaks
user trust and pushes people towards looking for alternatives.
