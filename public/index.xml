      <description>I recently switched my VSCode with RemoteWSL workflow to NeoVim with LazyVim. While I&amp;rsquo;m still working out the quirks and features, it has helped my typing and navigation speed a lot, nevermind the fact that the editor loads in an instant.
I am working on integrating terminal tools as best as possible with native Windows features though, and as a beginner in vim configurations and the lua language, I have found myself pretty confused by most basic vim configuration stuff, but I am slowly going through the weeds.</description>
